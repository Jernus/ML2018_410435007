ML_Programming Assignment 1: Image Decryption using Linear Perceptron

Use Perceptron Learning Algorithm(PLA) to decrypt image.
<Steps>
1. load image into python.
2. Consider a picture made up of pixels in an array W x H.
3. Using //import numpy as np to convert.
4. Find out w1, w2.
5. Output the image
  
Problems: It's my first time to write this type's program. It's totally different to me. Therefore, I search as many as information from books, Internet, Github. However, I'm afraid couldn't finish before deadline...

Learns: I have learn how to use Python to do and solve the math problems.
